# Facial-Keypoint-Detection
Here, In this project Using Computer Vision techniques and Deep Learning to build end-to-end  Facial Keypoint Detection. Facial Keypoints include points around the Eyes, Nose, Mouth and around face corners.

The project will be broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks.
 Notebook 1 : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data

Notebook 2 : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints

Notebook 3 : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN

Notebook 4 : Fun Filters and Keypoint Uses
